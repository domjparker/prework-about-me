      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm currently a high school teacher.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Originally I'm from New Zealand, but I've been living in the US now for over 5 years, mostly here in Washington State, but also for a time in California.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I really enjoy running, hiking, biking, and traveling. I also am married with 2 young children, and so I enjoy spending time with my family.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't know what my dream job would be exactly, but I enjoy working with others in teams, and leading teams too. I like creating things and working on projects, which I'll say more about below.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Pierce County, Washington State. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I see being a web developer as my doorway into the tech industry. I like creating things and probably should have done some sort of engineering degree. So partly I just want to create things, figure things out, and make things better, and so I think tech is where i can have more opportunity to do this. </p>
